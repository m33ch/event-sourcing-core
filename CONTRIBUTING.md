  - **`store/`**: Contains implementations for storing and retrieving events and snapshots.
  - **`saga/`**: Handles process management using the Saga pattern.
  - **`concurrency/`**: Contains mechanisms to handle concurrency control (e.g., `ConcurrencySafeExecutor`).
  - **`index.ts`**: The main entry point that exports all modules.

- **`test/`**: Contains unit and integration tests to ensure the correctness of the library.

- **`examples/`**: (Optional) Real-world usage examples for reference.

- **`package.json`**: Defines the package dependencies, scripts, and metadata.

- **`tsconfig.json` / `tsconfig.build.json`**: TypeScript configurations for development and build.

- **`jest.config.ts`**: Configuration file for running tests with Jest.

- **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`**: Defines the code of conduct for contributors.

2. **Clone** your fork locally.
3. **Create** a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`.
4. **Implement** your changes, ensuring all tests pass.
5. **Commit** and push to your branch.
6. **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch.

## Code Guidelines

- **Style Guide**: We use [Google TypeScript Style](https://github.com/google/gts).
- **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- **Comments**: Document complex logic where necessary.
- **Avoid breaking changes** unless it's a major release.

---

## Testing and Coverage

- Run tests using `npm test` or `yarn test`.
- Ensure **100% test coverage** for unit tests.
- Tests must cover core classes like `AggregateRoot`, `BaseDomainEvent`, and `EventSourcedRepository`.
